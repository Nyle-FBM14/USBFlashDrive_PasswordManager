PassFort is a password manager that can live in a USB drive, providing local and offline alternative to online versions. I finished a minimum viable product (MVP). The GUI is not the best and could be more intuitive for the user. It provides the user the basic functions of storing and managing passwords. Data is stored and encrypted into a data folder. For now the app only works on a Windows machine. I have not done any rigorous testing like unit tests, but works for the most part.

See the docs image for what features have been implemented and future intentions for the project.

To run and use the app yourself, download the zip folder and extract it into your local computer or a USB drive, then run the PassFort executable.
